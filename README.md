#  NYC Public Schools â€“ SAT Performance Analysis

>  **Note:** This project is based on a guided DataCamp exercise. All code, analysis, and insights here are my own.

##  Project Objective

Analyze SAT performance across New York City public high schools to answer three key questions:

1. Which schools have the best math scores (â‰¥ 80% of max)?
2. Which are the top 10 schools based on total SAT score?
3. Which NYC borough has the highest variation in SAT performance?

##  Dataset Information

**File used:** `schools.csv`  
Each row represents a school with the following columns:

- `school_name`
- `borough`
- `average_math`
- `average_reading`
- `average_writing`

Each SAT section is scored out of **800**.
