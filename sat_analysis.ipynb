There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n\nAnalyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n\nYou have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.\n\nYou have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.","metadata":{},"id":"fe0ea788-58dd-459e-8976-fafdb5c05c6d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()\nschools.fillna(0, inplace=True)\n\n# Start coding here...\n# Add as many cells as you like...\n\navg_math = schools[schools[\"average_math\"]>=(0.8*800)].sort_values(\"average_math\", ascending=False)\nbest_math_schools = avg_math[[\"school_name\", \"average_math\"]]\n\nschools[\"total_SAT\"] = schools[\"average_math\"] + schools[\"average_reading\"] + schools[\"average_writing\"]\n\nschools.sort_values(\"total_SAT\", ascending=False).head(10)\ntop_10_schools = schools[[\"school_name\", \"total_SAT\"]].sort_values(\"total_SAT\", ascending=False).head(10)\n\nschools.set_index(\"school_name\", inplace=True)\n\n# Define the variable largest_std_dev_mean_std before using it\nlargest_std_dev_mean_std = pd.DataFrame()\n\nlargest_std_dev_mean_std[[\"average_SAT\",\"std_SAT\"]] = schools.groupby(\"borough\")[\"total_SAT\"].agg([np.mean, np.std]).round(2)\nlargest_std_dev_mean_std[\"num_schools\"] = schools.groupby(\"borough\")[\"total_SAT\"].count()\n# largest_std_dev.set_index(\"borough\")\nlargest_std_dev = largest_std_dev_mean_std[largest_std_dev_mean_std[\"std_SAT\"]==largest_std_dev_mean_std[\"std_SAT\"].max()]\n# largest_std_dev_ = largest_std_dev.rename(columns={\"mean\": \"average_SAT\", \"std\": \"std_dev\"})","metadata":{"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6","executionTime":31,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()\nschools.fillna(0, inplace=True)\n\n# Start coding here...\n# Add as many cells as you like...\n\navg_math = schools[schools[\"average_math\"]>=(0.8*800)].sort_values(\"average_math\", ascending=False)\nbest_math_schools = avg_math[[\"school_name\", \"average_math\"]]\n\nschools[\"total_SAT\"] = schools[\"average_math\"] + schools[\"average_reading\"] + schools[\"average_writing\"]\n\nschools.sort_values(\"total_SAT\", ascending=False).head(10)\ntop_10_schools = schools[[\"school_name\", \"total_SAT\"]].sort_values(\"total_SAT\", ascending=False).head(10)\n\nschools.set_index(\"school_name\", inplace=True)\n\n# Define the variable largest_std_dev_mean_std before using it\nlargest_std_dev_mean_std = pd.DataFrame()\n\nlargest_std_dev_mean_std[[\"average_SAT\",\"std_SAT\"]] = schools.groupby(\"borough\")[\"total_SAT\"].agg([np.mean, np.std]).round(2)\nlargest_std_dev_mean_std[\"num_schools\"] = schools.groupby(\"borough\")[\"total_SAT\"].count()\n# largest_std_dev.set_index(\"borough\")\nlargest_std_dev = largest_std_dev_mean_std[largest_std_dev_mean_std[\"std_SAT\"]==largest_std_dev_mean_std[\"std_SAT\"].max()]\n# largest_std_dev_ = largest_std_dev.rename(columns={\"mean\": \"average_SAT\", \"std\": \"std_dev\"})","executionCancelledAt":null,"lastExecutedAt":1749321410601,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":164,"type":"stream"},"1":{"height":550,"type":"dataFrame","tableState":{"customFilter":{"const":{"type":"boolean","valid":true,"value":true},"id":"5e808fd2-6e09-477a-86d0-aa75ef415c27","nodeType":"const"},"quickFilterText":""}}},"lastExecutedByKernel":"9e5292fc-0466-4e68-9afb-0aea8c542e07"},"id":"d0eb4f16-5a99-460d-a5ba-706b7ef0bbe7","cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.10","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"editor":"DataLab"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
